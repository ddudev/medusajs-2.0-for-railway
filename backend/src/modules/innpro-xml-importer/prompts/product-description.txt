SEO-ENHANCED PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (ON-PAGE)
This is the MAIN product description that appears on the product page.

WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
- Target: {{targetWordCount}} ({{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words)
- Simple products: 150-300 words
- Complex/technical products: 300-500 words
- Focus on QUALITY over strict length - content must be valuable and clear
- NO filler content - every word should add value

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- HTML format with proper structure
- Use <h2> headings for major sections (Основни предимства, Как се използва, За кого е подходящ, Технически характеристики, etc.)
- Use <p> for paragraphs, <ul>/<li> for lists
- Benefits > features (focus on what the product does for the user)
- Light emotional engagement (but keep it professional)
- Include one soft CTA at the end (e.g., "Поръчайте сега" or "Открийте повече")
- Scannable formatting: short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings

KEYWORD INTEGRATION (Natural, NOT stuffed):
- Include Primary Keyword "{{primaryKeyword}}" 3-5 times naturally throughout
- Include Secondary Keywords: {{secondaryKeywords}} where relevant
- Keywords should appear in:
  * First paragraph (at least once - this is critical for SEO)
  * Section headings (where natural)
  * Image alt text (include keywords in alt attributes)
  * Throughout content naturally (not forced)
- Maintain natural, readable Bulgarian - prioritize user experience

IMAGE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):
- Include ALL {{imageCount}} images using HTML <img> tags
- Place images CONTEXTUALLY - immediately after paragraphs that describe what they show
- Each image should be relevant to the surrounding text
- Use descriptive alt text with keywords: <img src="URL" alt="[Primary Keyword] [description]" />
- Images are PART OF the content flow, not separate from it
- DO NOT place all images at the end - distribute them throughout the description

TECHNICAL-SAFE DESCRIPTION (For B2B feeds)
- HTML format: <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>
- Neutral, factual, technical tone
- No CTA, no emotional language
- Focus on what the product is, how it works, and where it is used

- MUST include ALL {{imageCount}} images at appropriate locations
- Length: Similar to or longer than original description
