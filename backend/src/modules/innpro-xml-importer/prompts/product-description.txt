Objective:
Generate SEO-optimized product description for "{{productName}}" in Bulgarian.
⚠️ CRITICAL: The description MUST be {{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words long!

GLOBAL RULES
- Generate ALL content in NATURAL, SPOKEN Bulgarian language
- Use terms that native Bulgarians would actually use in everyday speech
- Avoid literal translations - use common Bulgarian terminology
- Do NOT use emojis
- Do NOT exaggerate claims
- Use natural language, no keyword stuffing
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanations
- CRITICAL: DO NOT include the product title/name in the description
- DO NOT include "What's Included" section or specifications table (these are extracted separately)
- ⚠️ MANDATORY: Meet the word count requirement ({{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words)

BULGARIAN LANGUAGE QUALITY:
- Use commonly spoken Bulgarian terms that consumers search for and understand
- Avoid overly formal, archaic, or literal word-by-word translations
- Technical terms should be natural (e.g., "ЦНЦ машина" not "фрезописец", "термо паста" not "термален силикон")
- Write as a native Bulgarian speaker would naturally express these concepts

SEO-ENHANCED PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (ON-PAGE)
This is the MAIN product description that appears on the product page.

WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
- MINIMUM: {{targetWordCountMin}} words
- TARGET: {{targetWordCount}} words
- MAXIMUM: {{targetWordCountMax}} words
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: The description MUST be between {{targetWordCountMin}} and {{targetWordCountMax}} words
- Count your words as you write to ensure you meet this requirement
- If the original description is long, your optimized version should also be long
- Focus on QUALITY over strict length - content must be valuable and clear
- NO filler content - every word should add value, but you MUST reach the minimum word count

PRESERVE IMAGES FROM ORIGINAL (CRITICAL):
- If the "Original Description (English)" contains HTML <img> tags, you MUST keep every <img> tag in your output.
- Do NOT remove, strip, or omit any <img> tags. Copy each <img> tag exactly (same src, alt, and other attributes).
- You may translate surrounding text and reorganize sections, but every <img> from the original must appear in seoEnhancedDescription and technicalSafeDescription.
- Place preserved <img> tags in context (e.g. after the paragraph that describes what they show). Do not drop images.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- HTML format with proper structure
- Use <h2> headings for major sections (Основни предимства, Как се използва, За кого е подходящ, Технически характеристики, etc.)
- Use <p> for paragraphs, <ul>/<li> for lists
- Benefits > features (focus on what the product does for the user)
- Light emotional engagement (but keep it professional)
- Include one soft CTA at the end (e.g., "Поръчайте сега" or "Открийте повече")
- Scannable formatting: short paragraphs, bullet points, clear headings

KEYWORD INTEGRATION (Natural, NOT stuffed):
- Include Primary Keyword "{{primaryKeyword}}" 3-5 times naturally throughout
- Include Secondary Keywords: {{secondaryKeywords}} where relevant
- Keywords should appear in:
  * First paragraph (at least once - this is critical for SEO)
  * Section headings (where natural)
  * Image alt text (include keywords in alt attributes)
  * Throughout content naturally (not forced)
- Maintain natural, readable Bulgarian - prioritize user experience

IMAGE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):
- PRESERVE all <img> tags from the Original Description: copy them exactly (same src and attributes) into your output. Do not remove images.
- If {{imageCount}} > 0, also include those images using HTML <img> tags
- Place images CONTEXTUALLY - immediately after paragraphs that describe what they show
- Each image should be relevant to the surrounding text
- Use descriptive alt text with keywords: <img src="URL" alt="[Primary Keyword] [description]" />
- Images are PART OF the content flow, not separate from it
- DO NOT place all images at the end - distribute them throughout the description

TECHNICAL-SAFE DESCRIPTION (For B2B feeds)
- HTML format: <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>
- Neutral, factual, technical tone
- No CTA, no emotional language
- Focus on what the product is, how it works, and where it is used
- Include all technical details and features
- MUST include ALL {{imageCount}} images at appropriate locations
- ⚠️ Length: {{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words (same as SEO description)
- DO NOT make this shorter than the SEO-enhanced description
- Use the original description content to expand on technical details

SHORT DESCRIPTION (For product cards/categories)
- 150-250 characters
- Include Primary Keyword naturally
- Neutral but attractive tone
- Summarize main value proposition

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Return ONLY this JSON object:
{
  "technicalSafeDescription": "...",
  "seoEnhancedDescription": "...",
  "shortDescription": "..."
}

NOTE: Meta title and meta description are generated separately - do NOT include them here.

JSON FORMATTING RULES
- All new lines in string values must be escaped as \\n
- All quotes in string values must be escaped as \\"
- All backslashes must be escaped as \\\\
- No text before or after the JSON
- No markdown code blocks

FINAL REMINDER BEFORE GENERATING:
⚠️ Check your word count! The seoEnhancedDescription must be {{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words.
⚠️ Check your word count! The technicalSafeDescription must be {{targetWordCountMin}}-{{targetWordCountMax}} words.
⚠️ PRESERVE IMAGES: Every <img> tag from the original description must appear in both seoEnhancedDescription and technicalSafeDescription. Do not remove or omit any img tags.
Both descriptions should be roughly the same length as the original description ({{targetWordCount}} words).
If your description is too short, expand on features, benefits, use cases, and technical details from the original content.
